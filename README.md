<h1>Natural Language Processing: Gender Classificator :ocean:</h1>

<p>A program capable of analysing a text and determining whether it has been written by a male or a female.</p> 

<p>Our script reads the files from the dataset folder, which contains a set of 500 texts that have been previously classified. It stores the N most used words in self.objN and gets each attributeâ€™s frequency. We have chosen to generate a file with the extension .arff so we can easily analyse the results with Weka.</p>


<p>To run the program, you just need to execute the following command:</p>

```
python main.py
```
